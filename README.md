## Stocklysis
### Inspiration
Finance often feels like a foreign language—an essential life skill that many never learn. We’ve seen friends, classmates, and even seasoned professionals grapple with sudden market shifts, unsure how to react or plan for the future. This gap in financial literacy can lead to missed opportunities and costly mistakes. Stocklysis was born out of a desire to bridge that gap, combining cutting-edge AI for market anomaly detection with an engaging, simulation-driven learning environment that demystifies finance for everyone.
  
### What It Does
**Stocklysis** is an educational platform that tracks real-time market data to detect unusual price swings and market anomalies in the moment. Users can:
  
- **Learn by Doing:** Step into a simulated trading environment where you place buy/sell orders whenever our system flags an anomaly.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Our LSTM-based anomaly detector and Z-score analysis identify when something’s off. We then leverage GPT‑4 to provide concise explanations and relevant news sentiment.
- **Pause and Reflect:** At each anomaly, the simulation halts, offers a snapshot of market context, and prompts you to decide how you’d trade in that scenario.
- **Visual Analytics:** Interactive charts and dashboards help users see how their decisions would play out over time, turning market complexity into an understandable experience.


## How We Built It
### Frontend:

- **Streamlit:** We built a streamlined, Python-based interface that rapidly prototypes the dashboard and user interactions. Its modular design makes real-time chart updates seamless.
- **Visual Design:** We focused on an intuitive layout, displaying dynamic charts and simplifying complex metrics for easy interpretation.

### Backend:

- **Python:** Powered our LSTM implementation for time-series data analysis, Z-score computations, and integration with external APIs.
- **Market Data APIs:** Ingests real-time and historical stock prices, enabling the system to detect anomalies and simulate trades against realistic conditions.
- **NLP & GPT‑4:** Parses headlines and economic events to provide fundamental analysis and news sentiment, giving users the ‘why’ behind the ‘what.’
- **Alert Mechanism:** Once anomalies are flagged, the system sends notifications and seamlessly updates the frontend with new insights and user prompts.


### Challenges We Ran Into  
- **Real-Time Data Handling:** Incorporating streaming APIs and processing large data volumes without hitting rate limits or timeout errors.
- **Model Accuracy:** Fine-tuning LSTM to detect sudden market changes without overwhelming users with false positives.
- **User Experience:** Displaying dense financial and NLP-driven information in a friendly, digestible format—especially under time constraints.
- **Integration Pitfalls:** Merging the AI pipeline (anomaly detection, news sentiment, and GPT‑4 summarizations) into a single, coherent product.

### Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- **Seamless AI Integration:** Bringing together LSTM-based anomaly detection with GPT‑4 for news summarization in a real-time environment.
- **Gamified Learning:** Creating a fully interactive simulation that halts at anomalies, prompting users with immersive, step-by-step trading decisions.
- **Educational Impact:** Offering a platform that helps beginners overcome the intimidation of market volatility by providing clear insights and context around each move.
- **Streamlit Scalability:** Successfully building a dynamic, data-driven UI in Python that remains responsive and aesthetically pleasing.

### What We Learned
- **Designing for Clarity:** Adapting complex financial models into a user-friendly interface pushed us to refine both the technical design and the user journey.
- **Data Pipeline Management:** Managing continuous data ingestion and on-the-fly anomaly detection required robust error handling and efficient API usage.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Coordinating between AI model outputs, streaming data, and real-time visual updates taught us the value of modular, well-documented code.
- **Financial Nuances:** Building a realistic trading simulation and integrating fundamental analysis gave us deeper insights into the interplay between technical indicators and market sentiment.

### What's Next for Stocklysis
- **Expanded Asset Coverage:** Incorporating more asset classes like ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and global indices.
- **Social Trading Features:** Allowing users to share strategies, compare outcomes, and compete on leaderboards for a more immersive learning experience.
- **Advanced AI Modules:** Refining our language models for deeper fundamental analysis, possibly fine-tuning them on broader market data and user feedback.
- **Personalized Learning Tracks:** Introducing quizzes, badges, and performance metrics that cater to users’ skill levels, encouraging daily engagement and steady skill growth.

Stocklysis is our vision of a finance education tool that transforms real-time market chaos into a captivating, hands-on learning adventure—because it’s time we all had the power to make confident financial decisions.
